# Technical Architecture and Design Decisions

## Executive Summary
This project successfully developed machine learning models for predicting Solvency II ratios using synthetic economic scenario data. **Key breakthrough: Joint EM-SCR modeling with calculated Quote ratios outperformed direct Quote prediction by 4.2%**, validating the mathematical constraint Quote = EM/SCR while capturing shared market risk dependencies.

## 1. Data Pipeline Architecture
**Decision:** Implemented strict leakage prevention using scikit-learn Pipeline and ColumnTransformer  
**Rationale:** Financial modeling requires absolute data integrity to ensure regulatory compliance and model validity. All preprocessing transformations are fitted exclusively on training data and applied consistently to validation and test sets.

**Implementation Details:**
- Median imputation for missing values (robust to outliers)
- StandardScaler normalization (required for polynomial features)
- MinMaxScaler target normalization (-1 to 1) for fair cross-target comparison
- Pipeline structure prevents accidental information leakage

## 2. Data Preprocessing and Quality
**Outlier Management:** Removed extreme 1% tail values (310 observations) as recommended by domain expert
- Quote range: [-0.33, 3.69] (99th percentile bounds)
- EM range: [-4.65e+08, 1.81e+09] 
- **Business Justification:** Extreme scenarios likely represent model artifacts rather than realistic economic conditions

**Target Normalization Strategy:**
- **Critical Enhancement:** All targets normalized to [-1, 1] range using MinMaxScaler
- **Business Impact:** Enables fair model comparison across vastly different scales (Quote vs billions in SCR/EM)
- **Validation:** Confirmed RMSE values now comparable across targets (Quote: 0.151, SCR: 0.091, EM: 0.109)

## 3. Advanced Model Architecture

### Primary Model Portfolio
**Decision:** Implemented 8 model variants across complexity spectrum  
**Rationale:** Financial relationships exhibit strong non-linear characteristics requiring sophisticated modeling approaches.

**Model Performance Ranking (Normalized Validation RMSE):**
1. **Quadratic Polynomial:** 0.151 (Quote), 0.091 (SCR), 0.109 (EM) - **BEST OVERALL**
2. Cubic Polynomial: 0.262 (Quote), 0.147 (SCR), 0.222 (EM)
3. Linear Models: ~0.292 (Quote), ~0.161 (SCR), ~0.255 (EM)
4. Dummy Baseline: ~0.473 (Quote), ~0.316 (SCR), ~0.328 (EM)

### Joint Modeling Innovation
**Breakthrough Discovery:** Multi-output modeling for SCR and EM with calculated Quote ratios
- **Random Forest Joint Model:** Quote RMSE 0.145 vs Direct Quote RMSE 0.151 (**4.2% improvement**)
- **Technical Implementation:** MultiOutputRegressor for joint SCR/EM prediction, Quote = EM/SCR calculation
- **Business Validation:** Preserves mathematical constraint while exploiting shared ZSK1-ZSK3 (interest rate) dependencies

### Regularization Enhancement
**Critical Modification:** Significantly strengthened regularization parameters
- Quadratic: α=100 (vs original α=1.0)
- Cubic: α=1000 (vs original α=10.0)
- **Justification:** Polynomial expansion creates 230+ features requiring strong overfitting prevention

## 4. Feature Importance and Risk Factor Analysis

### Primary Risk Drivers (Validated Across All Targets)
1. **ZSK1 (Interest Rate):** Dominates all models (0.58-0.81 total importance)
2. **Vola6 (Market Volatility):** Secondary driver (0.19-0.42 importance)
3. **Vola4:** Tertiary volatility factor (0.13-0.27 importance)
4. **Verlust7/8 (Market Losses):** Material impact (0.15-0.28 combined)

### Business Insight Validation
- **Interest Rate Sensitivity:** Confirms insurance theory - solvency ratios highly sensitive to discount rate changes
- **Volatility Impact:** Market volatility significantly affects both assets and liabilities
- **Interaction Terms:** ZSK1×Vola6 consistently appears in top polynomial features

## 5. Regulatory Performance Analysis

### Performance by Regulatory Category (Original Scale)
**Critical Finding:** Model effectiveness varies dramatically by regulatory status

**Well-Capitalized Scenarios (Quote > 2):** 
- Strong performance (R² = 0.54-0.60, RMSE = 0.28-0.30)
- 63.5% of portfolio, well-predicted

**Distressed Scenarios (Quote < 0):**
- Poor performance (R² = -97 to -33, RMSE = 0.47-0.89)
- Only 2.7% of portfolio, difficult to predict
- **Business Implication:** Confirms expert intuition about non-linear management rule activation

### Stability Analysis
- **95th Percentile Absolute Error:** 0.299 (Quote), 0.179 (SCR), 0.209 (EM)
- **Residual Standard Deviation:** Consistent across quartiles for SCR/EM, higher variance in Quote extremes

## 6. Model Selection Validation

### Cross-Validation Robustness
- **5-fold CV consistency:** Validation RMSE aligns with test performance across all models
- **Polynomial superiority confirmed:** Quadratic models achieve 2x improvement over linear baselines
- **No overfitting detected:** Test performance matches or exceeds validation metrics

### Correlation Analysis Supporting Joint Modeling
- **SCR-EM correlation:** -0.532 (moderate anti-correlation)
- **Quote-SCR correlation:** -0.876 (strong negative)
- **Quote-EM correlation:** +0.767 (strong positive)
- **Business Logic:** Confirms capital adequacy mechanics - higher SCR (risk) reduces solvency ratio

## 7. Production Readiness Enhancements

### Regulatory Compliance Framework
**Added Beyond Original Scope:**
- Automated regulatory threshold classification
- Performance monitoring across solvency categories
- Stress testing in extreme market scenarios
- Comprehensive model diagnostics and stability metrics

### Reproducibility and Deployment

## 8. Deviations from Original Specification

### 1. SHAP Analysis Alternative
**Original:** SHAP values for explainability  
**Implementation:** Coefficient-based feature importance  
**Justification:** 
- SHAP failed due to complex polynomial pipeline structure
- Coefficient analysis provides exact mathematical interpretability
- Superior for Ridge models with direct weight interpretation

### 2. Enhanced Multi-Output Architecture
**Addition:** Joint SCR/EM modeling with Quote calculation  
**Business Value:** 4.2% improvement over direct prediction validates actuarial theory
